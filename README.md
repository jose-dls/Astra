### TL;DR

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

\* The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Credit

This theme is built on the official Astro [blog](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples/blog) template generated using `npm create astro@latest` which is based off of the lovely [Bear Blog](https://github.com/HermanMartinus/bearblog/).

With that being said, _a lot_ of the content/styling has been modified and only the base logic remains the same. Please do check out the lovely templates mentioned above.
